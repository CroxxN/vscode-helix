This is a fork of an older Helix extension which in itself was a fork of the VSCode Vim extension. So there are still a lot of references to Vim in this source code. It is a work in progress.

## Commands

The main commands should work but selections currently do not.

Right now commands are hardcoded to the [default keymap](https://docs.helix-editor.com/keymap.html), hopefully this can be adjusted to the user's keymap in the future.

If something doesn't work, please open an issue.
